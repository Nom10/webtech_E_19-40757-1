Early years
Reus was born in Dortmund, North Rhine-Westphalia. He began to play football for his hometown club Post SV Dortmund in 1994 and joined the youth ranks 
of Borussia Dortmund in 1996. He played for Borussia Dortmund until he left for the U-19 team of Rot Weiss Ahlen in the summer of 2006. During his first year there, 
he played as an attacking midfielder and was featured in six games for the club's second team, which played in the Westphalia league at the time. He scored a goal in each of his first two games. 
The following year, he was able to break into Ahlen's first team, which played in the German third division at the time. He featured in 16 games that season, two of which he started. His only goal
came on the last matchday, where he played the full 90 minutes for the first time that season, and propelled the team to promotion into the 2. Bundesliga. In 2008–09, as a 19-year-old, he had his 
definitive breakthrough as a professional football player, playing 27 games and scoring four goals.<br>

On 25 May 2009, Reus signed a four-year contract with Bundesliga club Borussia Mönchengladbach.

At the start of the 2011–12 season, Reus began the season in fine form, scoring 10 goals in his first 13 matches, including his first ever Bundesliga hat-trick in a 5-0 trashing against Werder Bremen on 19 November. 
His contract with Gladbach was set to expire in 2015 and reportedly had a buy-out clause of €18 million. Reus mentioned that his role model was Tomáš Rosický.<br>

2012–13 season
On 4 January 2012, Reus signed with his former club Borussia Dortmund for a €17.1 million transfer fee on a five-year deal. He spoke about his transfer saying, 
"I've made the decision to take the next step forward in the coming season. I'd like to play for a club who can challenge for the league title and guarantee me Champions League football. 
I see this chance in Dortmund." Reus officially re-joined Dortmund on 1 July. In Reus's league debut with Dortmund on 24 August, he scored a goal as his new side completed a 2–1 win over Werder Bremen.

 with Real Madrid at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium on 6 November, netting on a spectacular volley after a kick-down from teammate Robert Lewandowski. In Dortmund's following Champions League match, 
 on 21 November, Reus scored Dortmund's first goal in a 4–1 defeat of Ajax at the Amsterdam Arena, securing qualification for the Round of 16 as Group D winners.

On 16 February 2013, Reus scored a hat-trick, netting all the goals in Dortmund's thumping of Hessian side Eintracht Frankfurt. On 9 April 2013, Reus scored an injury time goal which was a vital
 one in the stunning injury time comeback against Malaga in the quarter final leg 2 of UEFA Champions League. Dortmund won the match by 3-2 and progressed on to the next round where they 
 defeated Real Madrid 4–3 on aggregate to reach the final. On 11 May, Reus scored a late brace against VfL Wolfsburg to help Dortmund draw the match after being two goals down.<br>

  He then scored a brace against SC Freiburg, one from the penalty spot, and started the season hitting impressive form. Reus had confirmed he would be Dortmund's penalty taker for the season, 
  though despite winning a penalty against 1860 Munich in the DFB Pokal, he allowed teammate Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang in taking the penalty which propelled the Borussia-based club into the next round of 
  the competition.[24] On 1 November, Reus scored a goal for Dortmund in a 6–1 league win against VfB Stuttgart.
